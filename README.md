Marketplace Performance Analysis for Magist Using SQL and Python
Magist Marketplace Analysis – SQL & Python Project
🎯 Project Overview

This project analyzes the Magist marketplace dataset to determine whether partnering with Magist is a strategically sound decision for a logistics/OMS company.
The analysis focuses on seller performance, delivery speed, product categories, price levels, freight costs, and customer satisfaction. Using SQL (MySQL) and Python for deeper insights, the goal is to evaluate operational reliability and marketplace quality.

📊 Dataset & Sources

The Magist dataset is derived from the public Olist e-commerce dataset:

🔗 Dataset Source:
Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist (Kaggle)

Dataset details:

~100,000 orders

Multiple relational tables (orders, customers, sellers, products, reviews)

Time range: 2016–2018

Clean and comprehensive e-commerce transaction dataset

🚀 Key Findings & Results

High-tech products represent a very small share of Magist’s overall catalog.

Average delivery times vary strongly depending on seller location and product category.

Freight value significantly affects final product cost, especially for heavy and oversized items.

Customer satisfaction is mixed, with a notable portion of reviews being neutral or negative.

Seller performance is inconsistent—a few sellers dominate while many have low volume.

Business Conclusion

Magist can be a viable partner only for certain product categories and with strict seller selection criteria.
High-tech categories are underrepresented, and delivery speed must be carefully evaluated before signing a partnership contract.

📝 Project Reflection
Summary

This project evaluated whether Magist is a suitable partner by analyzing marketplace structure, delivery performance, and product categories. SQL queries and visual analysis allowed me to identify strengths and weaknesses of the platform.

Languages and Libraries Used

Python, SQL

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

MySQL Workbench, Google Slides, GitHub

Key Learnings

Strengthened SQL skills (JOINs, aggregations, subqueries).

Improved ability to interpret marketplace dynamics and operational data.

Learned how to present technical findings in a clear, business-focused format.

Practiced Git version control workflows as taught in the Git workshop.

Challenges Overcame

Handling multiple relational tables and understanding the schema.

Cleaning inconsistent product and delivery data.

Managing large datasets and converting SQL logic into meaningful visuals.

Upload limitations on GitHub (dataset too large) → solved by linking Kaggle source.

Additional Reflections

This project deepened my understanding of marketplace analytics and real-world business decision-making. It also helped me build confidence in structuring a full analytical pipeline—from SQL to presentation—and documenting everything professionally on GitHub.
